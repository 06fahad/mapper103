# mapper103
A mapping software which uses OpenStreetMap's API to extract data and uses the data to create a Graphical Information System software. Shortest path finding algorithms such as Djikstra's algorithm and A\* algorithm are also implemented to facilitate routing. A slightly altered version of the Travelling Salesman Problem is also addressed, where the objective is to find a shortest possible path for a delivery service where the delivery truck must pick up a package before it can visit a dropoff location, thus putting additional constraints on the traditional TSP. Algorithms such as greedy search, 2-opt swap are implemented to meet this objective.
